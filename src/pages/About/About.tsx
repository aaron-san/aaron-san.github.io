      <p>
        I am a finance, programming, and food junkie. I have lived in Japan for
        the past eight years and have developed programming projects over that
        time. For example, I developed a large program that collects
        fundamentals data from multiple sources and attempts to clean and
        convert the various formats into similar, comparative data that can be
        used in a financial analysis pipeline. If you would like to talk, then
        shoot me an <a href="aaronhard6@gmail.com">email</a>.
